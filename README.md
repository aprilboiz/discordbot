# DiscordMusicBot

Simple Discord Music Bot can play songs from Youtube or SoundClound.

## How to use?
This bot is mainly written in Python. So you will need to install Python before doing other things.
### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) >= 3.10
- Required packages are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- You will need a token for your bot to run. Place your token in the `.env` file in the root folder with the format `TOKEN=<your_token>`
  
After doing these things, your bot now can be run. Open your terminal in the root folder and type this command: `python main.py`
By now, your bot should be run properly. If it does not run, take a quick look in `discord.log` file for errors ^^
